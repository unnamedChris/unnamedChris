# Hi, I'm Chris! ðŸ‘‹

I am an IT professional and programmer passionate about creating software solutions and exploring new technologies. I currently live in Switzerland, near Zurich, but I am originally from Germany, more specifically from near Stuttgart. I work at a small startup in software development and system administration, and I moved to Switzerland for this job back in 2022. In my free time I create content for my youtube channel or play video games. If you like you can contact me through my management *(email below)*, and maybe we can work together on a projekt.
